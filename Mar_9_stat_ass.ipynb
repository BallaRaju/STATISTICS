    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which have a countable set of possible outcomes. It assigns probabilities to each possible outcome. The PMF gives the probability of observing a specific outcome. The sum of all the probabilities in the PMF is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF for X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",

    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF tells us that each outcome has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PDF is used for continuous random variables, which have an uncountable set of possible outcomes within a range. The PDF gives the probability density of an outcome. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of a specific outcome, but instead describes the relative likelihood of different outcomes. The area under the PDF curve within a range represents the probability of observing an outcome in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider the height of adult humans as a continuous random variable. The PDF of heights may follow a normal distribution. The PDF describes the relative likelihood of different heights. It shows that heights near the mean have a higher density, indicating they are more likely to occur, while heights farther from the mean have lower densities and are less likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probabilities of specific outcomes. The PDF is used for continuous random variables and gives the probability density of outcomes."

It provides information about the probability distribution of the random variable and is used to determine probabilities associated with specific intervals or ranges of values.\n",

    "The CDF is defined for both discrete and continuous random variables.

The CDF gives the probability that a randomly chosen individual has a height less than or equal to a specific value. Suppose the CDF at a height of 170 cm is 0.75. This means that 75% of the population has a height less than or equal to 170 cm.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Physical measurements: Many physical measurements, such as heights, weights, blood pressure, and IQ scores, tend to follow a normal distribution. Therefore, the normal distribution can be used to model and analyze these types of measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Financial data: In finance, stock returns, asset prices, and other financial variables often exhibit a distribution that approximates a normal distribution. The normal distribution is commonly used in financial modeling, risk analysis, and option pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Errors in statistical analysis: In many statistical analyses, it is assumed that the errors or residuals of the model follow a normal distribution. This assumption is fundamental in various statistical methods, such as linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quality control: In manufacturing and quality control processes, when measuring certain product characteristics, the normal distribution is often used as a model to assess the variability and quality of the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the parameters of the normal distribution, they determine the shape, location, and spread of the distribution. The normal distribution is fully described by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean (μ): The mean represents the center or average of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak of the bell-shaped curve. Shifting the mean to the left or right changes the center point of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the distribution. It determines the width of the curve. A larger standard deviation results in a wider distribution, indicating greater variability, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower distribution with less variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the mean and standard deviation define the shape of the normal distribution. When the mean is at the center and the standard deviation is moderate, the distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. As the mean or standard deviation changes, the distribution may become skewed or more spread out.\n",

Central Limit Theorem: The Normal distribution is fundamental to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sum or average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will tend to follow a Normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the individual variables.
