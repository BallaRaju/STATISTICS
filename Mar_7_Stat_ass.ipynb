    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. It is calculated\n",
    "by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of\n",
    "values. The mean is affected by outliers since it takes into account all the values in the\n",
    "dataset.\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. To calculate the median,\n",
    "the data must be arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an odd number of\n",
    "values, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of values, the median is\n",
    "the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers compared to\n",
    "the mean.\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is the only\n",
    "measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal or categorical data. A dataset\n",
    "can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).\n",
    "Unlike the mean and median, the mode is not influenced by outliers since it only considers\n",
    "the frequency of values. If all values occur with the same frequency, the dataset is said to be\n",
    "\"unimodal\" without a specific mode."

    "1. Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing the\n",

    "points are distributed and how much they deviate from the central tendency measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference\n",
    "between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the total spread\n",

    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "Here's how outliers impact these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: Outliers can pull the mean towards their direction. Since the mean takes into\n",
    "account every value in the dataset, extreme values can greatly influence its value. For\n",
    "example, consider the dataset [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 1000]. The outlier value of 1000\n",
    "significantly increases the mean, pulling it away from the central values of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Median: Outliers have less impact on the median since it represents the middle value of\n",
    "the dataset. As long as the outlier is not within the middle values, the median remains\n",
    "relatively unaffected. In the above example, the median would remain the same as it is not\n",
    "influenced by the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mode: Outliers generally have no impact on the mode since it represents the most\n",
    "frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset. The mode remains the same regardless of the\n",
    "presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: Outliers affect the range by extending the spread of the dataset. The range\n",
    "increases as the distance between the minimum and maximum values widens due to\n",
    "outliers. In the previous example, the range would increase from 990 (1000 - 10) to 990\n",
    "(1000 - 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can substantially impact the variance and\n",
    "standard deviation. These measures quantify the spread of the dataset by considering the\n",
    "deviation of each value from the mean. Outliers increase the sum of squared differences,\n",
    "leading to higher variance and standard deviation. In the example, the variance and\n",
    "standard deviation would be much higher due to the influence of the outlier.\n",
